## Project Structure

The project has three main files:
  a.html: Contains the HTML structure of the page.
  a.css: Contains the CSS for styling the form and page layout.
  a.js: Contains the JavaScript for handling form submission and displaying a success message.

## Features

- A simple form with the following fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
- Displays a success message without refreshing the page on form submission.

## How It Works

1. The HTML file creates the form with input fields for the user's name, email, and message, and a submit button.
2. The CSS file styles the form, input fields, button, and success message to make the page look clean and user-friendly.
3. The JavaScript file (script.js):
   - Listens for the form submission event.
   - Prevents the page from refreshing on form submit.
   - Shows a success message below the form.
   - Clears the input fields after submission.
